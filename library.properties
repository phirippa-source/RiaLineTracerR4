sentence=Line tracer for Arduino UNO R4 WiFi + Zumo Reflectance Sensor Array (RC). Includes calibration, readLineWithStatus, PID, and PWM motor drive. Default emitterPin=2.
paragraph=RiaLineTracerR4 is a compact line-tracing library for Arduino UNO R4 WiFi with Zumo Reflectance Sensor Array (RC timing). It provides an optimized RC timing reader (early-exit), calibration (min/max), normalized readings (0..1000), weighted line position with line-lost status, PID (anti-windup), and PWM motor drive as class member functions. Default emitterPin is 2.
